 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My coding journey</h3></summary>
   I started my Frontend journey in mid-2021 when I decided to change my occupation and after thorough research I decided to master JavaScript as my main language. It was not easy, but well worth the time as I was hooked. Luckily online learning platforms like Udemy exist and provide great quality content and number of choices.<br />
   <br />
   Afterwards I dove deeper into the stack, got basic understanding of Backend alongside with some CSS and HTML. At that moment I knew that competent Frontend Developer needs to know at least one popular UI library or framework, so React was a quick pick. I was keen to progress further, which got me into Next.js. While doing all these courses, I really felt like I was behind on CSS, which did not felt right, so I decided to go for dedicated CCS training. All this sounds like a lot of study, but nowadays standards are higher than several years ago and from my research I grasped that much. TypeScript was next on my list of must know items.<br />
   <br />
   Right then I was feeling like I could try for a job, but was not feeling like my portfolio and skills were sufficient. Thats why I have joined trainee program at Itransition, which was very intensive and simulated fast paced work environment, where you have to adapt and learn on the fly. It was a great help and I improved a lot more than I expected. <br />
   So this is where I am right now, still learning and actively searching for a job in these hard times.
